# ETL Bike Shop Data Analysis
An ETL Project in Python, and SQL. Utilized Python's Pandas and SQL for data analysis & querying, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL for data warehousing.

Activities include extracting data from csv files. Transform the data using Python and Pandas, deleting duplicates and making sure Null values are valid, as well as data types are consistent. The data is then loaded into Neon's Cloud PostgreSQL database. I also perform more data checks on Neon with some SQL queries to make sure no data is lost in the process of loading. The process is then scheduled for automation using Airflow
